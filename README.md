# IP-Tracker
> IP-Tracker is an IP lookup tool that can provide exact details of the location of an IP address, as well as find out the city, state, zip code, and country. And not only that, as this tool can even display the hostname of an IP address and the Internet Service Provider that owns that address. This is because every device connected to the Internet has an associated IP address, which reveals its geographic location. IP addresses help data find its destination and arrive correctly.
